Certainly! Generative AI has made significant strides in assisting people across various domains. Here are **three examples**:

1. **ChatGPT and Bard for Conversations**:
   - **ChatGPT**, developed by OpenAI, uses generative AI and natural language processing to simulate human-like conversations. It can assist users with tasks such as drafting emails, essays, code, and more ⁴.
   - **Bard**, another language model, also relies on generative AI and powers features like Smart Compose and Smart Reply in Gmail ³.

2. **Medical Applications**:
   - **Ada**, a doctor-developed symptom assessment app, employs generative AI to offer medical guidance in multiple languages. It optimizes the expertise of human doctors, supporting improved health outcomes and delivering clinical excellence ⁵.

3. **Performance Management in Organizations**:
   - As AI-enabled digital tools continuously evolve, managing employees becomes challenging. The **STEP framework** helps address this by:
     - **Segmenting tasks** for either AI automation or augmentation.
     - **Transitioning tasks** across work roles.
     - **Educating workers** to leverage AI's evolving capabilities.
     - **Evaluating performance** to reflect learning and assistance provided by employees ¹.

Generative AI's impact extends beyond these examples, and its potential continues to grow as technology advances.
